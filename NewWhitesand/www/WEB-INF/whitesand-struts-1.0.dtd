	Cozilyworks XML Controller DTD, version 1.0
	@Authors: ordinarybackstreetmoldywilliam
	@Date: 2007-10-31
	This defines a simple and consistent way of creating a namespace
	of whitesand-struts's controllers whitch will be managed by a 
	Spring BeanFactory, read by	XmlBeanDefinitionReader (with 
	DefaultBeanDefinitionDocumentReader).

	XML documents that conform to this DTD should declare the following doctype:

	<!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC "-//Cozilyworks//DTD BEAN 1.0//EN"
		  "http://www.Cozilyworks.com/dtd/whitesand-struts-1.0.dtd">
-->

<!--
	The document root. A document can contain bean definitions only,
	also can contain some bean nodes.
-->
<!ELEMENT beans (
	description?, bean*
)>
<!--
	This Element containing informative text describing the purpose of the enclosing
	element. Always optional.
	Used primarily for user documentation of XML bean definition documents.
-->
<!ELEMENT description (#PCDATA)>

<!ELEMENT bean (
	description?
)>


<!--
	Optional. Can be used to create one or more aliases illegal in an id.
	Multiple aliases can be separated by any number of spaces, commas, or
	semi-colons (or indeed any mixture of the three).
-->
<!ATTLIST bean name CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	Each bean definition must specify the fully qualified name of the class,
	except if it pure serves as parent for child bean definitions.
-->
<!ATTLIST bean class CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	this attribute is not needed.cause when the spring's beanfactory will check 
	this attribute ,and infact we don't need it ,so there is a default value and
	also no other attributes to choose.
-->
<!ATTLIST bean autowire (byName) "byName">
